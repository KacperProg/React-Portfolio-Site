            Iâ€™m a curious problem-solver with a background in physics, finance, and full-stack development. I thrive on learning new skills, exploring diverse fields, and connecting ideas across disciplines. From coding projects to fund operations, I enjoy tackling complex challenges and delivering practical solutions. Iâ€™m usually exploring ways to grow personally and professionally â€” always looking for the next thing to learn. <br></br> <br />
            Here is a AI-Generated image of me in a suit! I plan for this to eventually be a "slide-show" of me in various random settings.
